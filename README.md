# screenadjs
This simple script makes it easy to use xrandr on a day to day basis. Although the script is adapted to my environment, I hope it will inspire you to  use it after a quick adaptation.

# Usage 

### `python screen.py s $x`
being $x 1 or 0 depending on the screen you want to work on.

### `python screen.py b $y`
being $y a number from 1 to 10 to adjust the brightness level.

### `python screen.py d`
This applies the automatic xrandr configuration, which adjusts the image to the entire monitor.
